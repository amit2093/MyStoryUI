It’s full of dreamers and hard-labourers, starlets and gangsters, stray dogs and exotic birds, artists and servants, fisherfolk and crorepatis (millionaires), and lots and lots of people. It has India’s most prolific film industry, some of Asia’s biggest slums (as well as the world’s most expensive home) and the largest tropical forest in an urban zone. Mumbai is India’s financial powerhouse, fashion epicentre and a pulse point of religious tension.",

Most of the song by other artists out there depict one particular situation (like a breakup song , a fallen in love song ) but the songs like In the end , new divide , what i’ve done and all of the songs of LP don’t depict one particular situation. They depict deep emotions and have a theme . you can imagine many situations that carry these emotions behind them. for instance listen to the song in the end. Here’s what people think what this song is all about and the number of situations they imagine is really really surprising.",

He then enters a portal to Wakanda, wrests the Mind Stone from Vision (not without a fight) and puts it in the Gauntlet. Thor arrives with Stormbreaker, and stabs Thanos, only to have Thanos snap his fingers anyway. Poof! Half of our heros dissolve into dust. Thanos escapes to a quiet place; ",
